Renegade Engine A fast, modular C++20 game engine built from scratch for flexibility, performance, and full control. Features fully custom: reflection, binary serialization, clean ECS, and an event-driven core — all written with minimal dependencies and zero editor bloat. Highlights Entity-Component System: Lightweight, scalable design. Reflection System: Static-init startup tool — no RTTI, no .gen files, minimal overhead. Binary Serialization: Pointer-safe, editor-ready, supports future type expansions by default. Event System: Callback-based, template-based, type-safe, and fully decoupled. Editor Tools: ImGui-based inspector UI powered by real-time reflection. Tech Stack Language: C++20 Platform: Windows (Linux coming later) Editor: Visual Studio 2022 Dependencies: ImGui, spdlog, stb, assimp, GLFW, GLAD In Progress 3D OpenGL Renderer (Deferred pipeline) Bullet Physics Integration Asset Management (with automatic unloading) ECS Memory Pooling Hot-reloading via DLLs Audio System Why? Because most engines are either bloated or inflexible. Renegade is for devs who want real control: minimal layers, clean APIs, and full understanding of what’s under the hood. License: Apache 2.0.
